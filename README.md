RED
===
Red is a jabber bot written in node.js with coffee-script. He knows how to
get things from time to time.

Red is an experiment; Nothing more. Right now all he can do is youtube and
google searches. He may also shout "Thats what she said" from time to time.
So what? You either get busy laughing, or you get busy dieing.
